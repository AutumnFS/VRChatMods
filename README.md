</details>

***Nameplates are seperate objects and will not impede on other mod features, you can disable or enable the nameplates live within the game to access incompatible features***
> Directly editing your MelonPreferences.cfg file will not update the nameplates and cause issues. Please use [UI Expansion Kit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods)


### Work in Progress
- Badge instantiation 
- Nameplate Stats 
- Avatar Loading Bars
- Setting Presets 
- AFK Detection 
- Camera Nameplates


# Planned Mods
### There is no ETA for these mods

## NSFW Enforcer (WIP)
NSFW Enforcer is a detector for NSFW avatars (Through tags or NSFW objects), adding safety options per world and rank.  
*The mod also may include the ability to flag NSFW avatars that have not flagged themselves as such*


## Custom Fallback (On Hold)
A replacement of VRChat's default fallback robot avatars, this is a popular feature in malicious/unverified mods. However, those rely on downloaded VRCA files.  
This version will utilize a different method of replacement that may be even more convenient anyways.
> Will probably have to take over Boothing in order to release, even recoding from scratch


## World Map
Adds an interactable map into the game, either attached to your hand, on your hud, or evn *possibly* as a spawnable table.
### Planned Features
- Spawnable Map Table  
- Hud details such as Coordinates and a Compass  
- Visible waypoints/beacons  
- Player Locator  


## Custom Emojis
A mod to allow the modification of the VRChat Emotes would let the user replace the emojis with custom images.
***This mod would not be able to add new emojis, only replace existing ones.***


## Better Trust (Collaborating With [Zen-VR](https://github.com/Zen-VR))
Better Trust is a total overhaul for the VRChat Safety/Trust system, replacing it with a localized database for trust management.  
This mod will allow users to specify what they consider is appropriate for trust based on the hours they spend with specific people or deprecate some ranks entirely.
> VRCX Synchronization on first load, or first instance of VRCX running


## VRCMMO
A large-scale addition to VRChat is an RPG-style leveling system for the platform.  
Interact with other users, explore the multiverse, or stare at mirrors and you will gain points for every activity.
### Planned Features
- World Events
- A party system
- Raid Bosses
- Achievements
- Titles
- *Runescape Theme Constantly Plays* - Thank you Hordini  
  ***Welcome back to Runescape***


## VRCModManager (Collaborating With [Davi](https://github.com/d-magit))
> Awaiting MelonLoader .Net 6 Update

A base library for interacting with the game, allowing mods to be loaded, updated, and even unloaded without having to close the game.   
The Repo manager would allow third-party repositories for other developers, encouraging the development of smaller-scale mods.    
***However, the opt-in process will warn users about the risks of running unverified code.***
