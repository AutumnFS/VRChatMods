# Released Mods
## Classic Plates
A modification to bring back the beloved nameplates of 2018 while remaining compatible with modern features.

![Classic Nameplates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FSCodingWaifu/VRChatMods/main/classic_nameplate.png)

### Features
- Modern Features such as VRC+ Profile Pictures, Fallback/Performance stats, and Quest Icons.
- Fully customizable, allowing *most* components to toggle on and off.
- Nameplates can be colored by Rank, Gradient, and Solid Color. *Maybe there's a secret rainbow mode :3*  
  ***plans include 2019, 2015, and 2014 Nameplates as well.***

### Compatability Notes for Other Modders
- Nameplates have a master detector built into them, showing up as a crown.
- Nameplates will have ease of implementation features, such as badge instantiation, native recoloring, and name modification.
> WIP currently, compatibility will be worked on as I continue to develop this mod. For now users can disable nameplates to have incompatible mod features.
- ***If you would like me to add anything, please send me a message on discord or submit an issue request.***



# Planned Mods
## NSFW Enforcer
NSFW Enforcer is a detector for NSFW avatars (Through tags or NSFW objects), adding safety options per world and rank.  
*The mod also may include the ability to flag NSFW avatars that have not flagged themselves as such*


## World Map
Adds an interactable map into the game, either attached to your hand, on your hud, or evn *possibly* as a spawnable table.
### Planned Features
- Spawnable Map Table  
- Hud details such as Coordinates and a Compass  
- Visible waypoints/beacons  
- Player Locator  


## Custom Fallback
A replacement of VRChat's default fallback robot avatars, this is a popular feature in malicious/unverified mods. However, those rely on downloaded VRCA files.  
This version will utilize a different method of replacement that may be even more convenient anyways.
> Will probably have to take over Boothing in order to release, even recoding from scratch


## Custom Emojis
A mod to allow the modification of the VRChat Emotes would let the user replace the emojis with custom images.
***This mod would not be able to add new emojis, only replace existing ones.***


## Better Trust (Collaborating With [Zen-VR](https://github.com/Zen-VR))
Better Trust is a total overhaul for the VRChat Safety/Trust system, replacing it with a localized database for trust management.  
This mod will allow users to specify what they consider is appropriate for trust based on the hours they spend with specific people or deprecate some ranks entirely.
> VRCX Synchronization on first load, or first instance of VRCX running


## VRCMMO
A large-scale addition to VRChat is an RPG-style leveling system for the platform.  
Interact with other users, explore the multiverse, or stare at mirrors and you will gain points for every activity.
### Planned Features
- World Events
- A party system
- Raid Bosses
- Achievements
- Titles
- *Runescape Theme Constantly Plays* - Thank you Hordini  
  ***Welcome back to Runescape***


## VRCModManager (Collaborating With [Davi](https://github.com/d-magit))
> Awaiting MelonLoader .Net 6 Update

A base library for interacting with the game, allowing mods to be loaded, updated, and even unloaded without having to close the game.   
The Repo manager would allow third-party repositories for other developers, encouraging the development of smaller-scale mods.    
***However, the opt-in process will warn users about the risks of running unverified code.***
