# VRChatMods
A compilation of all my mods. Released or Planned

## Classic Plates
A modification to bring back the beloved nameplates of 2018 while remaining compatible with modern features.
*Future plans include 2019, 2015, and 2014 Nameplates as well.*


## NSFW Enforcer
A detector for NSFW avatars (Through either tags or NSFW objects), adding in safety options per world and per rank.
*The mod also may include the ability to flag NSFW avatars that have not flagged themselves as such*


## Custom Fallback
A replacement of the default fallback robot avatars.
This is a popular feature in malicious/unverified mods, however those rely on downloaded VRCA files.
This version will utilize a different method of replacement that may be even more convenient anyways.


## Better Trust
A total overhaul for the VRChat Safety/Trust system, replacing it with a localized database for trust management.
This will allow users to specify what they consider is appropriate for trust based on the hours they spend with specific people, or deprecate some ranks entirely.

## VRCMMO
A largescale addition to VRChat introducing a leveling system to the platform.
Interact with other users, explore the multiverse, or stare at mirrors. No matter what your time is spent doing, you will gain EXP for doing it and level up.
### Planned Features
- World Events
- A party system
- Raid Bosses  
***Welcome back to Runescape***  

## VRCModManager
A base library for interacting with the game, allowing mods to be loaded, updated, and even unloaded without having to close the game.
A repo manager inside the game for all compatible mods and the ability to download them from inside the game
The Repo manager would allow third-party repositories for other developers, encouraging the development of smaller-scale mods.  
***However, the opt-in process will warn users about the risks of running unverified code.***
